### Social data analysis and visualization 2017

The current analysis is a final project created by two master students during the spring semester 2017 in the course (02806) Social data analysis and visualization, run by Sune Lehmann and the Technical University of Denmark.
The main topics of the course, besides python programming, are machine learning and data visualization (D3.js). The project has hence been thought out to leverage the techniques we've learned in those topics.
